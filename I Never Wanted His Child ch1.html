The chin-tightening grip of the hand distorted her forehead. Her hands were bound, leaving her unable to resist. She hadn’t expected that she would be humiliated like this, on her knees, on the ground, in just half a day.

“Aren’t you ashamed?”

Her clear voice filled the corridor. Even with the accusing look in her eyes, the man didn’t flinch. Instead, he seemed to smile as if he found this situation agreeable.

With a sharp snap, her teeth clenched and blood rushed in.

‘Mikhail von Heinrich.’

From the moment she first saw him, she had felt an inexplicable unease. Her instincts screamed that he was dangerous.

“Emilia von Loren. Stop resisting now. Everyone is waiting for your decision.”

“Ha!”

She offered a bitter smile in response to the man’s words.

“Don’t say absurd things. Do you think I would accept that?”

To become the wife of one who had plotted treason? She couldn’t accept it. Despite the fear shaking her pupils, she didn’t back down. Mikhail’s eyebrows twitched as he stared intently into her green eyes.

“It seems you still don’t grasp the situation.”

“Ugh.”

The man’s hand that had been holding her chin suddenly tightened and pulled her closer. In the confined space, she winced as their noses almost touched.

“You’ve been abandoned. Even by the ruler your family and you served.”

The emerald eyes, as if captured from the plains, widened. The red hair, like blood, clung to her face, and her pristine uniform was stained with an unknown person’s blood.

Contempt, hatred, murderous intent.

Emotions welled up within her as she looked up at the man who was looking down at her.

Reluctantly, she had to admit that, being alone in this vast castle, she was undeniably abandoned, just as the man had said.

“So, accept it.”

His breath reached her, and it was discomforting. She bit her lip, fighting the urge to respond to the triumph in his arrogant eyes.

If it was death, she would willingly accept it. She had stood her ground to the end for her beliefs, so there was nothing to regret. But to admit defeat and die like that, if he had proposed such a thing, she would have driven a blade into her own heart without hesitation.

He didn’t even offer her the chance to protect her last remaining shreds of pride and honor.

“Emilia von Loren, quietly enter my bed.”

Because that was the only way she could live. She chuckled as if he were showing her some kindness, then turned her head and bit his fingers lightly.

In a manner that suggested it would never go the way he desired, her green eyes curved prettily.

“Please don’t touch my body recklessly.”

Mikhail lowered his blood-stained hand and, with a stoic expression, pulled a handkerchief from his pocket.

“Your Grace! Are you all right?”

The knights rushed forward, ready to draw their swords as if they would strangle her at any moment.

He, however, raised his hand nonchalantly to stop them. He bent down and, with a twisted smile, studied Emilia’s face stained with red blood.

Then he twisted his head and whispered in her ear.

“Well, even if you became the king’s mistress, it won’t matter to me.”

He glanced at her trembling hand. She, filled with shame and regret, didn’t elicit any sympathy. She should have made better choices from the start.

“…The king’s…?”

She hated it.

As Mikhail ruthlessly cut down people, memories of Adrian standing behind him with a wicked smile came flooding back. If she was to become his mistress, she knew she wouldn’t be able to live with a clear conscience.

“……I’d rather kill him. I’d rather die! I’d rather die!”

She made a face that she was saying nonsense, but she said it clearly.

Mikhail lightly dismissed her desperate cry. He burst into a short laugh and looked down at her with a cold stare.

“That’s impossible. Your damned father has already signed the marriage oath. So, in reality, you are already nothing more than my wife,” his voice dripped with contempt.

Emilia’s pupils quivered under his intense gaze. The word ‘wife’ emerging from his lips, laced with palpable hatred, felt unnatural and eerie.

She looked up at him with a forlorn expression, wondering why he despised her so, even as he claimed her as his own.

Emilia wore an expression of utter disbelief. Mikhail, on the other hand, didn’t believe that a parent could so easily abandon their child. However, faced with death, Duke Loren readily abandoned her.

Was that all? All the nobles who had supported Prince Johannes Konrad in the past had the same sentiment. For the sake of their own safety, they agreed to Emilia marrying Mikhail.

What was clear was that Emilia was the only one rejecting the proposal.
