            he wanted to die.<br>

          <br>But Emilia was forced to become the wife of a traitor against her will.<br>
            
          <br> When she thought there was nothing more to despair about, the king issued an outrageous order for her to bear his child.<br>
            
          <br> Hatred grew endlessly.<br>
            
          <br> “So, bear the child. Emilia von Heinrich.”<br>
            
          <br>“What exactly is our relationship?”<br>
            
          <br> “I sow my seed in you, and you receive my seed to bear a child. We use each other as a means out of necessity.”<br>
            
          <br>His definition was simple.<br>
            
          <br> But as the burning hatred slowly faded away with each night spent with him, as she got to know him better, her feelings became less clear.<br>
            
          <br> Eventually, as the truth came closer, she left while carrying his child.<br>
            
          <br>She couldn’t hate him or resent him anymore.<br>
            
          <br> The once arrogant man, after her departure, cried out in regret.<br>
            
          <br> And Mikhail, too, became someone who couldn’t hate or resent her.<br>
