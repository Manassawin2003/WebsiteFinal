            Transmigrated into “The Boys” universe as the ultimate supervillain "Homelander", Azu wasn't too thrilled about it.<br>

            <br>However, he soon discovered that his abilities came with proficiency, and maxing out proficiency levels allowed him to level up and even develop new abilities.<br>
            
            <br>Your ‘Laser Eyes’ proficiency is at maximum.<br>
            <br>Now upgraded to ‘Laser Eyes+1.’<br>
            <br> Laser Eyes+1: Cutting power +50%, penetration +20%, overall damage +35%<br>
            <br> Your ‘Steel Body’ proficiency is at maximum.<br>
            <br> Now upgraded to ‘Steel Body+1.’<br>
            <br> Self-Healing: Wound healing speed +300%<br>
            <br>This was a game-changer. After leveling up a few times, let’s see who dares to challenge me!
