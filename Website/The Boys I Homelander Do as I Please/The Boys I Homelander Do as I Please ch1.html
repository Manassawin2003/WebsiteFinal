      Ring, ring, ring.

      The sound of the alarm clock irritated Azu.
      
      "Who set the alarm?"
      
      "Today is Sunday. Can't I have a decent sleep?" He grumbled.
      
      He climbed out of bed, rubbing his eyes.
      
      As he opened his eyes, he saw a room with European-style decor.
      
      Azu was momentarily stunned.
      
      He rubbed his eyes again.
      
      He was sure this wasn't his room.
      
      Furthermore, hanging on the wall was a set of azure battle gear with a star-spangled cape.
      
      Next to it were golden belts, along with red gloves and boots.
      
      "Prop costume?"
      
      Azu walked over, picked up the azure battle suit, and compared it to himself.
      
      Then he turned to look at the full-length mirror on the wall.
      
      "What the heck!" He exclaimed.
      
      In the mirror, he saw a blond Caucasian man.
      
      He jumped in shock.
      
      Then he waved his hand.
      
      The man in the mirror mimicked his movements.
      
      "Is that me?"
      
      Azu couldn't help but pinch his own face.
      
      It hurt.
      
      It didn't feel like a dream.
      
      Have I crossed over?
      
      At that moment, a woman outside the bedroom door spoke in English, "Homelander, I hope I'm not disturbing you."
      
      "But there's a press conference scheduled for later."
      
      "Madeline thought it necessary to remind you."
      
      Wait.
      
      Who?
      
      Homelander?
      
      Are you calling me?
      
      Have I become Homelander?
      
      Azu looked at the full-length mirror and asked, "Can I shoot lasers from my eyes?"
      
      As soon as the thought crossed his mind, the man in the mirror's eyes lit up, emitting red light.
      
      In the next moment, two red beams shot out, shattering the full-length mirror.
      
      The woman outside heard the noise and quickly called out, "Homelander, are you okay?"
      
      Azu hurriedly replied, "I'm fine."
      
      Then he looked at the battle suit in his hand and the charred and damaged wall.
      
      He accepted a fact.
      
      "I've crossed over and become Homelander!"
      
      Homelander is a superhuman character in "The Boys," and he is quite powerful in the series, possibly even a ceiling-level superhuman.
      
      He is extremely selfish, vengeful, and has a severe Oedipus complex.
      
      He's also conceited, proud, and insane.
      
      In short, his personality is extremely vile.
      
      Azu admired his superpowers, but becoming Homelander was a different story.
      
      Now, whether he liked it or not.
      
      He had become Homelander.
      
      A moment later, Azu left the room. He had integrated Homelander's memories, knew what abilities he had, and how to use them.
      
      He also knew that the woman with glasses holding a tablet next to him was named Ashley.
      
      She was Madeline's secretary and assistant at Vought.
      
      Ashley carefully concealed her fear and wore a professional smile as she handed him the tablet, saying, "Homelander, please take a look. This is the content we're going to announce today."
      
      "Later, you can come to the venue for a rehearsal."
      
      "Oh, and in the afternoon..."
      
      Azu extended a finger and gently pressed it against Ashley's lips.
      
      His other hand was behind his back, and he smiled, revealing eight teeth. "My dear Ashley, I have something more important to do now."
      
      "Please don't disturb me."
      
      Ashley shook her head in bewilderment. "Do you have something to attend to?"
      
      "That's none of your concern." Azu walked towards the window beside the corridor.
      
      Ashley hastily said, "Please come back soon and don't be late. Madeline asked me to remind you."
      
      "I'll do whatever I want, so don't tell me what to do."
      
      "This is the first time and also the last time."
      
      Azu smiled. Then he crashed through the window.
      
      Bang!
      
      The window shattered.
      
      Azu had turned into a blue streak of light and disappeared into the sky.
      
      The wind blew in from outside the building.
      
      It left Ashley in disarray.
      
      "He's gone mad."
      
      "He's gone crazy again."
      
      In the sky.
      
      "Yahoo!" Azu cheered. He had always dreamt of soaring through the sky like a bird, and now he could finally do it.
      
      Homelander's flight abilities allowed him to fly freely in the sky at incredible speeds.
      
      After flying for a while, Azu looked up at the high sky, intending to test the limits of his abilities.
      
      So, he shot upwards with all his might.
      
      The distance between him and the ground kept increasing, and in no time, he had ascended to an altitude of ten kilometers.
      
      But he kept going higher into the sky.
      
      Frost began to form on his suit.
      
      The next moment, flames appeared all around his body, and he entered the atmosphere!
      
      Azu squinted his eyes.
      
      Then he accelerated suddenly.
      
      In an instant, he burst out of the atmosphere and into outer space.
      
      He found that he could survive in outer space.
      
      He was now like a true Homelander.
      
      He gazed at the infinite expanse of stars and wondered if he could just fly away.
      
      But then he shook his head.
      
      It didn't seem to have much meaning.
      
      He also tried shooting lasers in all directions, and red beams of light streaked through space, disappearing into the depths of space.
      
      In his attempts, Azu discovered that he could adjust the power of his laser eyes.
      
      The power could be divided into three levels.
      
      The lowest was "Non-lethal Mode," the middle was "Lethal Mode," and the highest was "Destruction Mode."
      
      After some experimentation, Azu decided to return. At that moment, a message appeared before him.
      
      [Laser Eyes: Proficiency 8/10]
      
      Proficiency? What was that?
      
      Azu was puzzled.
      
      Then another message appeared.
      
      [Flight: Proficiency 4/10]
      
      [Warning: Disaster event will occur in 1 hour and 7 minutes.]
      
      Could it be that proficiency could be maxed out, and Homelander could upgrade to a higher level?
      
      Could Homelander become a greater superhero?
      
      Now, Azu was excited.
      
      Initially, he thought Homelander was just a watered-down version of a superhero, comparable to a one-man army.
      
      But facing immensely powerful weapons like nuclear bombs, he didn't know if he would survive.
      
      But now, he, as Homelander, could potentially level up.
      
      That changed everything.
      
      Once he reached the level of a greater superhero, surviving a nuclear bomb would be child's play.
      
      Then, he could truly do whatever he wanted.
      
      But what was that warning about a disaster event?
      
      Ah, never mind.
      
      I'm Homelander now. I have the power to handle anything!
      
      Azu closed his eyes and muttered softly, "This is true freedom, ultimate freedom."
      
      "Ha-ha-ha-ha!" He burst into laughter and flew into the atmosphere, disappearing as a blue streak of light.
      
      
      
      At the press conference venue, Ashley was frantic.
      
      Suddenly, she heard the sound of rushing wind, followed by a figure descending from the sky, gently landing on the ground.
      
      Homelander had arrived!
      
      She heaved a sigh of relief.
      
      Then, leading the way, she said, "Please follow me."
      
      Azu walked into the venue with a smile, and his appearance immediately captivated countless cameras.
      
      The flashlights hardly stopped for the next five minutes.
      
      Azu smiled as he faced the cameras and approached the interview stage.
      
      He lightly tapped one of the microphones and said, "I apologize for keeping you all waiting."
      
      Ashley also chimed in, "Next, you can feel free to ask any questions."
      
      Immediately, a reporter asked, "Homelander, can you tell us about your upcoming plans?"
      
      "Such as a new movie, merchandise, or perhaps an ice cream flavor named after you?"
      
      Azu looked around, showing no signs of nervousness.
      
      His immense power gave him the confidence to face the world.
      
      He smiled and said, "What I'm about to say may sound like a joke to you."
      
      "But I'm dead serious."
      
      "Plans?"
      
      "I do have one."
      
      "But it's not a movie, merchandise, or any ice cream."
      
      "We are superheroes, not celebrities or clowns for entertainment."
      
      "So, my plan is to reform The Seven. I want to lead this team to do what it should be doing."
      
      "Instead of making those darn movies!"
      
      The venue fell silent.
      
      At The Seven's headquarters, Madeline, the Vice President of Vought, had just finished breastfeeding her child and put on a coat. She saw the live broadcast of Homelander's outrageous statement at the press conference.
      
      "What the hell."
      
      "What's wrong with him!"
      
      Madeline grabbed her phone and called her assistant, Ashley, shouting, "Why did you let him say those things?"
      
      "What's wrong with him?"
      
      The voice of a gentle woman came from the phone, "I assure you, Madeline, he's perfectly fine."
      
      "And don't blame Ashley; this was his own decision, unrelated to her."
      
      Madeline's expression immediately softened. "John, do you have any troubles?"
      
      "It's alright, you can confide in me. I'm waiting for you in the office."
      
      "Could you please pass the phone to Ashley?"
      
      "Wait a moment."
      
      After a while, Ashley's voice came through the phone, "I'm here, Madam."
      
      Madeline's expression darkened. "Tell the reporters that Homelander was just joking with them a moment ago."
      
      "Next, we will announce Homelander's latest plans, including a movie, two TV shows, and a series of merchandise, all of which he is interested in."
      
      "Damn it, how could you let him say such things!"
